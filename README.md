# For the motion detection project the first version modec.py captures with the available cameras connected to the users device.
# The program displays three frames simultaneously that contain an original feed, an hsv feed and an rgb feed. 
# Use the cv2.VideoCapture(0) to assign which system camera you want to use.
# Changing the number in the parameter, cycles through the connected video devices.
